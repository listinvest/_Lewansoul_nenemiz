### NOTES:
- distance for cross bars flush to sides is 43mm

### TO DO:
- Need to reduce calf-bar location by 4mm so it looks flusher with knee.
- Remove pocket for calf-horn and add instead a 1mm pillow.
- Move pelvis upper motor a couple more mm on X so that leg can fold close to 170 deg.
- Design feet
- Design thigh bar
- Reduce ~50mm from Leg Length, so it ends being ~200mm. Body should be another 100mm high and head about 50mm

### UPDATE ALREADY DONE ON FREECAD BUT NEED UPDATE ON BLENDER:
- calf_hinge
- calf_bar
- thigh_hinge
- thigh_horn
