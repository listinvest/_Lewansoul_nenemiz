### NOTES:
- distance for cross bars flush to sides is 43mm

### TO DO:
- Need to reduce calf-bar location by 4mm so it looks flusher with knee.
- Move pelvis upper motor a couple more mm on X so that leg can fold close to 170 deg.
- Design thigh bar
- Reduce ~50mm from Leg Length, so it ends being ~200mm. Body should be another 100mm high and head about 50mm

### UPDATE ALREADY DONE ON FREECAD BUT NEED UPDATE ON BLENDER:
- none

### PARTS THAT NEED MIRRORING ON BLENDER AND FOR 3D PRINT SO RIGHT LEG CAN BE BUILT
- ankle_2_foot_horn
- thigh_hinge
- calf_horn
